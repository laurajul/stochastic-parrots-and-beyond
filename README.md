## Overview

Researchers use generative AI more and more. Its environmental costs, training data, labor conditions, representations, commercial incentives, and governance often get separate treatment. This workshop puts them together.

Participants examine text and image generators through four analytical lenses:

1. Stochastic Parrots: scale and environment.
2. Representation and Displacement.
3. Lifecycle and labor: materiality and extraction.
4. Political economy: power and markets.

Then the group uses the Liberating Structures [Panarchy](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/panarchy) and a short adaptation of [Ecocycle Planning](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/ecocycle-planning). With these methods, participants find feasible changes in their own research settings. The aim is a transparent and defensible position on generative AI in research. The aim is not a list of permitted and forbidden tools.

## Who This Is For

| Reader                             | Start here                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| A participant in a Basel edition   | The [edition pages](https://maehr.github.io/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond/contents/editions/hs2026.html) give the date, the venue, and the preparation.                                                                  |
| A student who studies on their own | The [four lenses](https://maehr.github.io/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond/contents/syllabus.html) and the [literature](https://maehr.github.io/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond/contents/literature.html).                    |
| A teacher who reuses the course    | The [reuse guide](https://maehr.github.io/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond/documentation/reuse.html) and the [facilitator guide](https://maehr.github.io/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond/contents/panarchy-facilitator.html). |

## Editions

One set of teaching materials serves all editions. The practical facts differ for each edition.

| Edition              | Status                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Autumn semester 2026 | Confirmed                           |
| Spring semester 2027 | Planned. Details are not confirmed. |

The edition pages on the website show the date, the venue, and the rules for each edition. The file `data/editions.yml` is the single source for these facts. The [official University of Basel course listing](https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/hauptfachbereich/dissertation--phd/stochastic-parrots-and-beyond-normative-dimensions-of-generative-ai-303499) overrides this repository.

This site is a course companion. It does not take registrations and does not award credits. The Graduate Center (GRACE) of the University of Basel does both.
